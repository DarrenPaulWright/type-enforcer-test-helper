 *
 * This library consists of two things. First is a data set of variations of different data type instances and values, along with coercible values, many of which were hand picked from the [big-list-of-naughty-strings](https://github.com/minimaxir/big-list-of-naughty-strings). Second is a handful of functions to help in testing type-enforcer and type-enforcer addons.
